# LOC Reduction Report — feature 013-z2f-editor-migration

**Generated**: 2026-04-25
**Baseline commit**: `d38d863` (chore(deps): bump @zod-to-form/{core,react} to ^0.8.0, the commit *immediately before* Phase 3 / US1 began)
**Final commit**: `1ba9631` (013-z2f-editor-migration HEAD)
**Spec target**: SC-001 — total LOC in editor forms folder MUST decrease by ≥25%

## Summary

**SC-001 is NOT met.** Editors LOC went from **5,868 → 6,052**, a net change
of **+184 lines (+3%)**. The migration prioritised parity (FR-012/SC-004) and
end-user behavioural unchanged-ness over aggressive LOC reduction.

| Phase target | Outcome |
|---|---|
| ≥25% reduction (SC-001) | ❌ +3% increase |
| ZERO end-user-visible regressions (FR-012) | ✅ all 651 tests still pass |
| ZERO graph-action contract changes (FR-002) | ✅ EditorFormActions diff empty |
| All AST-canonical (R1, FR-008) | ✅ form-schemas.ts deleted; identityProjection helper for all five forms |
| Custom rows via FormMeta.render (US6) | ✅ 4 row renderers registered |
| Sections declarative (US5) | ✅ section: config + componentModule wired |
| Inherited rows via ghost rows (US4) | ✅ arrayConfig.before in DataTypeForm |
| Reorder via z2f primitive (US2) | ✅ arrayConfig.reorder true on attributes[] |

## Per-file deltas

Largest reductions and growths by file:

| File | Baseline | Final | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `FunctionForm.tsx` | 711 | 550 | **−161** |
| `EnumForm.tsx` | 400 | 368 | **−32** |
| `DataTypeForm.tsx` | 471 | 530 | +59 |
| `AttributeRow.tsx` | 348 | 397 | +49 |
| `MetadataSection.tsx` | 231 | 288 | +57 |
| `AnnotationSection.tsx` | 136 | 187 | +51 |
| `ConditionSection.tsx` | 396 | 475 | +79 |
| `EnumValueRow.tsx` | 283 | 287 | +4 |
| `TypeAliasForm.tsx` | 243 | 233 | −10 |
| `ChoiceForm.tsx` | 283 | 283 | 0 |
| **New: `FunctionInputRow.tsx`** | — | 88 | +88 |
| Other (TypeSelector, expression-builder/*, etc.) | unchanged | unchanged | 0 |

(Outside `editors/`: new helper files in `forms/sections/` and `forms/rows/`
add ~250 LOC. The two deletions — `forms/ExternalDataSync.tsx` (65 LOC) +
`forms/MapFormRegistry.ts` (~50 LOC) + `schemas/form-schemas.ts` (147 LOC)
+ `test/schemas/form-schemas.test.ts` (~280 LOC) — net to roughly +0 LOC
across the rest of the package.)

## Why SC-001 missed

The migration's per-form changes broke roughly even because three things
each *added* LOC:

1. **Section components grew** (Annotation +51, Condition +79, Metadata
   +57). Phase 7 made them work in *both* the old prop-callback path
   (still used by the imperative JSX in the forms) **and** the new
   declarative `section:` path (back-compat fallback via
   `EditorActionsContext`). The dual-mode adds branches; the per-form
   imperative inclusion was kept intentionally to ship the migration
   safely. Cleanup belongs in a follow-up that removes the imperative
   `<AnnotationSection ...>` / etc. from each form's body once visual
   parity is independently verified — see "Future LOC opportunity"
   below.
2. **AttributeRow grew** (+49) because it now reads AST paths
   (`attributes.${i}.typeCall.type.$refText`, `attributes.${i}.card`)
   and translates `RosettaCardinality { inf, sup, unbounded }` ↔ the
   `(0..*)` string the `<CardinalityPicker>` API accepts. The
   translation costs lines but preserves the
   `EditorFormActions.{addAttribute,updateAttribute}` contract
   (FR-002).
3. **DataTypeForm grew** (+59) because `useFieldArray({ name:
   'attributes' })` over the AST shape requires more explicit
   construction (`makeAttributeAstItem` builder for new rows, `useRef`
   tracking of the AST `superType.$refText` shape, etc.) than the
   projection's flat `members[]` did.

The single reduction worth highlighting is **FunctionForm −161** —
removing the imperative section JSX cascade *did* shrink that file
notably; it was the largest pre-migration form (711 LOC) so the
absolute drop is visible.

## Future LOC opportunity (out of this feature's scope)

A follow-up that removes the imperative `<AnnotationSection
onAdd={...} onRemove={...}>` (and the equivalent
`<ConditionSection>`, `<MetadataSection>`) JSX from all five forms,
relying entirely on Phase 7's declarative `section:` config to render
them, would:

- Drop ~30–50 LOC of section invocation JSX per form (~150 total)
- Allow the section components themselves to drop the prop-callback
  back-compat path (~30–50 LOC each, ~120 total)
- Estimated total: ~270 LOC reduction → would put us at roughly **5,782
  LOC final, a ~1.5% drop**, still well short of the SC-001 25% target

**Recommendation**: revise SC-001 down to a parity-or-better goal (≤+5%
LOC change), or treat the spec's 25% target as aspirational and
explicitly waived by FR-012 (visual parity) which we did meet. The
real-world wins from this migration are not LOC: they are
single-source-of-truth schema canonicalisation (R1), zero hand-rolled
form plumbing on the validation path, and the open door for the
`?z2f` build-time pipeline to take over rendering (deferred,
inspector-z2f-migration scope).

## Method

```bash
# baseline (commit immediately pre-Phase-3)
git show d38d863:packages/visual-editor/src/components/editors/<file>.tsx | wc -l

# final
find packages/visual-editor/src/components/editors -name "*.tsx" \
  -not -name "*.test.tsx" -exec cat {} \; | wc -l
```

## T071 — EditorFormActions parity audit

`git diff d38d863..013-z2f-editor-migration -- packages/visual-editor/src/types.ts`
returns **zero changes**. The graph-action contract is byte-identical
between the pre-migration baseline and the final 013 head. **FR-002
satisfied.**
