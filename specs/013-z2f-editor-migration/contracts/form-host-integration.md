# Contract: Form Host Integration

**Branch**: `013-z2f-editor-migration` | **Phase**: 1 (design)
**Audience**: implementers of any of the five form slices (Phases B and D)

This document defines the integration contract between the editor pane (which
holds the selected graph node and per-kind action callbacks) and the form host
(`<ZodForm>` plus the upstream primitives from `010-editor-primitives`). It is
the contract every form-slice PR must satisfy.

---

## 1. Inputs the form host receives

Each form receives the same prop shape it does today (see e.g.
`DataTypeForm.tsx:88-105`). The migration does NOT change these prop names or
their semantics:

- `nodeId: string` — graph identity of the selected node.
- `data: AnyGraphNode` — the AST-shaped payload of the node. **Identity**
  (object reference) is the source of truth for "this is a different node".
- `availableTypes: TypeOption[]` — type-selector options.
- `actions: EditorFormActions<K>` — the kind-narrowed action surface
  (see `data-model.md` §5). Stable across re-renders unless the host
  intentionally swaps it.
- `allNodes?: TypeGraphNode[]` — for inherited-member resolution.
- `renderExpressionEditor?: (props) => ReactNode` — optional rich-editor slot.
- `onNavigateToNode?: NavigateToNodeCallback` — for type-link navigation.
- `allNodeIds?: string[]` — for resolving type names to node IDs.

The form host MUST NOT require additional props beyond this set; any new
configuration is encoded in `z2f.config.ts`, not in the form's prop shape.

---

## 2. Source-object binding (external sync)

The form is bound to `data` by **reference identity**:

- When `data !== prevData` (strict reference change), the form host calls
  `form.reset(toFormValues(data), { keepDirtyValues: true })`. This is the
  upstream `useExternalSync(form, data, toValues)` hook (R4 of
  `research.md`). The previous custom `<ExternalDataSync>` component is
  removed.
- When `data === prevData` but a *property* of `data` changed by mutation,
  the form host MUST NOT reset. Pristine fields stay current via the natural
  React render cycle; dirty fields are protected by `keepDirtyValues`.
- When the user has an in-flight debounced commit at the moment `data`
  identity changes, the pending commit MUST flush against the *original*
  `nodeId` before the form repopulates with the new node's values. This
  preserves the existing behaviour described in spec Edge Cases.

**Failure mode**: if `toFormValues(data)` throws (e.g. malformed AST), the
form host MUST surface the error to the surrounding error boundary rather
than render a blank form. The spec's edge case ("source doesn't satisfy the
schema") is *not* this case — that one is a Zod validation issue at field
level, not a projection error.

## 3. Reorder-event flow (graph round-trip)

For arrays configured `arrayConfig.reorder: true` in `z2f.config.ts`:

1. The user drags or keyboards a row from `fromIndex` to `toIndex`.
2. The upstream reorder primitive updates form state (the
   `useFieldArray.move()` equivalent) and emits a reorder event with `(from,
   to)`.
3. The form's reorder-handler (e.g. `handleReorderAttribute` in
   `DataTypeForm.tsx:204-210`) MUST forward the event verbatim:
   `actions.reorderAttribute(nodeId, fromIndex, toIndex)`. No re-mapping, no
   re-derivation from form state.
4. The graph store reconciles; the AST-shaped `data` reference changes; on
   the next render, `useExternalSync` is a no-op because the user-driven
   change already moved form state to the same end state.

**Add/Remove between reorders**: if the user adds or removes a row between
two reorders, the actions replay against the graph in the order they fired
(spec US2 Acceptance Scenario 3). The form host owes nothing extra here —
React's render order already provides the sequencing — but each PR's tests
MUST cover this case.

---

## 4. Auto-save debounce semantics (preserved)

Per-field commits remain on a per-field `useAutoSave(commitFn, 500)` debounce
(R8). The contract:

- The form host does NOT introduce a top-level debouncer in this migration.
- Each `commit*` callback in the form body wires through the action surface
  (`actions.renameType`, `actions.updateDefinition`, etc.).
- A row-level commit (e.g. attribute name) fires its row's `onUpdate(...)`
  callback, which closes over `nodeId` and the row index and forwards to
  `actions.updateAttribute(...)`.
- Switching nodes mid-debounce (see §2) flushes the pending timer first.

**Measurement**: SC-007 budgets ±50 ms of pre-migration timing. Each form
slice MUST include a regression test that measures debounce latency at the
action-fire point; the test asserts the total elapsed time between the input
event and the action call is within the budget for a representative leaf
field per form.

---

## 5. Failure modes and developer warnings

- **Section component referenced but not registered**: form host emits a
  developer-mode warning to the console and renders nothing for that
  section (matches spec Edge Case §5).
- **Row-renderer registered but the item-schema has no `[]` traversal in
  the typed config**: form host falls back to the default item rendering and
  emits a developer-mode warning.
- **`actions[<name>]` is `undefined` when the form fires it**: the form
  surfaces a developer-mode error and continues. This protects against
  accidentally narrowing the action surface (`EditorFormActions<K>`) wrongly
  in the host.

All warnings/errors above are dev-only (gated on `import.meta.env.DEV` or the
upstream equivalent). Production builds do NOT emit them.
