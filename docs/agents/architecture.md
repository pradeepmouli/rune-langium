# Architecture and Invariants

Current source and package manifests take precedence over historical specs.

## Package Map

| Area | Responsibility and entry points |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | Rune grammar, generated AST/domain/Zod surfaces, parsing, linking, validation, and serialization. `src/services/rune-dsl-module.ts` exposes `createRuneDslServices`, which composes generated and custom Langium services and registers validation. |
| `packages/lsp-server` | Language-server integration over the core language services. |
| `packages/codegen` | Native generation, imports, Rosetta rendering, and instance utilities. `src/generator.ts` orchestrates namespace generation; `src/emit/namespace-walker.ts` supplies shared normalization. |
| `packages/visual-editor` | React Flow graphs, forms, adapters, and editor state; consumes core and codegen. |
| `packages/design-system` | Shared theme, tokens, and UI primitives. |
| `apps/studio` | React IDE, workspace persistence, browser workers, provider composition, and Pages Functions. |
| `packages/git-sync-engine`, `packages/curated-schema` | Shared Git synchronization and curated-model contracts. |
| `packages/instrumentation-core`, `packages/worker-core` | Shared instrumentation and Worker infrastructure; Worker logging lives in `worker-core/log`. |
| `apps/lsp-worker` | Hosted LSP sessions in `RuneLspSession` Durable Objects. |
| Other worker apps | Curated-model mirror, GitHub authentication, codegen gateway, and telemetry. |
| `packages/codegen-legacy`, `apps/codegen-container` | Legacy JVM/Rosetta bridge and container path; Java 21 and `rosetta-code-generators` still apply here. |
| `apps/docs`, `site` | Documentation and landing page, combined with Studio into the Pages artifact. |

The main dependencies are Studio → visual-editor/codegen/LSP/core,
and CLI/codegen/LSP → core.

## Studio Runtime

- Studio uses React 19, React Flow 12, Dockview, zustand 5/zundo 2, Tailwind CSS 4, Base UI, and CodeMirror 6. Manifests currently use TypeScript 7 and Langium 4.3; check manifests before changing versions.
- OPFS stores workspace files; IndexedDB stores metadata, caches, settings, and layouts.
- Workspace activation reconciles the shared model store with the destination bindings before parsing or persisting them. New/close clear files, deferred declarations, hydration, selection, previews, and undo history in memory while preserving the previous workspace on disk. Pending parse/load results are invalidated across that boundary. Superseded restores leave the newer workspace's screen alone; the winning import owns the loading screen and exits restoring mode. Superseded imports discard only their newly created empty record.
- `apps/studio/src/shell/providers/StudioProviders.tsx` composes provider responsibilities; `LspProvider.tsx` owns the LSP client and transport lifecycle.
- `WorkbenchHost` owns Dockview mounting, stable panel bridges, native-layout restore, serialization subscriptions, and disposal. Each perspective supplies a `WorkbenchDefinition` with its panels, titles, and default builder. `DockShell` remains Explore's adapter: it owns migration of `PanelLayoutRecord`, the Explore factory layout, toolbar/shortcuts, center-pane policy, and utility-tray collapse behavior. Per-workspace perspective preferences use versioned workbench settings; they must contain UI state only, never model payloads or generated artifacts.
- **Studio LSP is network-only.** `apps/studio/src/services/transport-provider.ts` defaults to session-token minting followed by a token-gated WebSocket to the hosted LSP. Only an explicit `wsUri` opts into direct WebSocket, with token-gated fallback after failure. Configured endpoints can differ between local, preview, and production environments.
- Parser and codegen browser workers handle local model operations; they do not provide an LSP fallback.
- Parser workspace replacement uses one reset for parse and hydration, including empty snapshots. Langium's builder removes parsed documents and their index/build state; indexed deferred stubs are removed separately before registering the replacement. Scope snapshots must never retain symbols from removed files.
- Expression owners retain graph declaration kind through Studio's scope request. Core's `findExpressionOwner` resolves both the editor and worker owner, including the unique base declaration of a function dispatch group. Duplicate bases and ambiguous legacy names fail closed, so same-named Data and function declarations keep distinct bodies and conditions. This lookup works for parsed and serialized models without container pointers. Core's `getExpressionOwners` groups declarations across all namespace files; the graph adapter and Studio's source-file lookup use that same selection, so variant-first file order cannot bind Inspector to a dispatch variant. A lone variant remains visible in the graph but cannot acquire a base expression binding or Builder scope. Builder and foreign-expression drafts capture the workspace dependency snapshot, validate it after asynchronous scope loading and again on Apply, and retain their private text when that snapshot is stale.
- `LspProvider` keeps full source/CST only for the active file (including curated source once loaded). It incrementally synchronizes compact canonical models for that namespace's import and resolved-reference closure, including function-body references. Browser namespace caches remain intact across navigation; the hosted LSP prunes unrelated or replaced snapshots before upload to avoid retaining two corpus generations. All dependencies use Langium's authoritative scope/link services. Live editor buffers override snapshots; closing a source view restores its semantic model. Serialized declaration ranges support cross-file definition navigation without fetching every source file. The Durable Object persists models in bounded chunks and restores them before rebuilding the active source on wake.
- Curated/reference-only models have distinct hydration and editing capabilities. Check deferred hydration, diagnostics, inheritance, and bare/qualified references when changing them; do not equate visibility with editability.
- Source synchronization serializes and updates writable workspace files only. Read-only and reference-only files remain byte-identical even when they share a namespace. Routed user models already published to the graph must not be published again by deferred document linking; curated models still enter the graph when first materialized.
- Curated namespace artifacts carry original file `content` alongside the serialized AST. Both artifact builders preserve upstream comments and formatting. The parse response sends serialized models only for immutable artifact keys the browser has not received; the browser retains prior documents across workspace switches in the same tab and reconstructs the full closure for the parser worker's replacement-style hydration. Source text is fetched separately through `/api/curated-source` only for the selected namespace and cached by artifact key for read-only browsing. An absent source is a loading state, not an empty file. List-only namespaces remain deferred. Legacy artifacts without content still hydrate, but displaying their original source requires rebuilding and publishing the artifacts.
- Center panes stack vertically when their container becomes too narrow for the selected pane count; the wide layout retains draggable horizontal splits.
- Center controls use one pill panel with a larger gap between the exclusive Graph/Structure view and Source/Inspector companion panes. Accessible groups retain that distinction. Structure refits its existing camera after a settled pane resize; avoid fixed content minimums that overflow split panes.
- Global Search uses the editor node repository, workspace files, and perspective registry. Type results and explorer name/arrow actions use Explore's hydration-aware navigation bridge; file search requests Source through the file-navigation store. Explicit type navigation reveals the target kind, and an empty Graph offers recovery instead of enabled camera actions.
- Export's workbench definition reconciles dock constraints after default construction and native-layout restore. Empty generated output starts compact; the first artifact expands only the untouched default group, preserving restored or manually arranged output panes.
- Close transports during reconnect/disposal so server-side sessions and documents can be released.
- The LSP connection adapter converts returned or thrown vscode `ResponseError` values into thrown lspeasy protocol errors for ordinary request handlers. Cancellation must travel in JSON-RPC's error field, never as a successful completion payload.

## Form Configuration

Studio's `apps/studio/z2f.config.ts` is the authoritative canonical `@zod-to-form/core` config, imported by its Vite plugin. `components.source: './z2f-components'` resolves relative to each schema module in `src/codegen-forms/`. Generation settings live under `defaults`; `defaults.optimization.compileZod` is independent of optimization level and defaults to false here. Presets expand through the shared resolver, preserving controlled shadcn event props.

Visual-editor's typed `z2f.config.ts` preserves AST hidden fields, sections, schema overrides and array reorder. Its component adapters use `value`/`onChange`; its `FieldTemplate` composes shared design-system primitives. These adapters must override raw shadcn event contracts explicitly. Do not restore removed `fieldTypes`/`formPrimitives` config keys.

The five hand-authored EditorForms use the shared `editorOptimization` policy with L1 enabled and Zod compilation disabled. `EditorFormProvider` supplies cached per-field validators to `EditorController`, resolving canonical AST schemas through object/array paths. This includes identifier unions skipped by the upstream L1 walker. All bespoke RHF Controllers must use that bridge; enabling the hook flag alone drops validation. Unknown loose-object fields (such as `expressionText`) retain their existing dedicated validation. Graph-level diagnostics remain in `ErrorsSection`. The generated-form configuration remains independently unoptimized; it does not install the runtime editor bridge.

## Shared Semantics

- Core normalizes bare functional expressions only at the parser lexer boundary. The bracket scanner is shared with `insertImplicitBrackets`; token offsets and columns map back to original UTF-16 source positions before CST construction. Synthetic brackets have empty images and zero-width CST ranges. CST text, diagnostics, reference locations and serialized text regions all address the original document.

- Core `BASE_TYPE_FILES` owns the standard Rune types and annotations. Studio re-exports it; the shared `RuneWorkspaceManager` loads it during LSP initialization, including reconnects. Core and LSP factories install `RuneDslSharedModule`.
- `hydrateModelDocuments` registers every parsed root before `RuneJsonSerializer` invokes Langium's reference revival. Keep one object graph: repeated deserialize rounds retain stale generations and cannot resolve arbitrary cycles. Batch tests must verify target identity across long chains and cycles.
- Curated downloads use a disposable browser worker; user-file-only downloads use `/api/codegen`. Both call `src/services/codegen-download-handler.ts` for validation, namespace closure, generation, and packaging. Hydration closes the documents that may be resolved; `ExportSelection` then chooses dependency-closed declaration roots for emission; `generateSelected` returns that exact receipt with the outputs, including a kind-aware `requiredBy` provenance map. Artifact envelopes record the receipt, immutable curated manifest cohorts when available, and generated files, so Studio previews and downloads use the same captured ZIP. Preserve fatal diagnostics and terminate the browser worker on completion, error, or timeout.
- Curated mirror CORS uses the shared worker origin matcher and the explicit `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` list in its Wrangler config, including this project’s Pages previews and local Studio ports.
- Curated manifests record bundle dependencies as well as namespace dependencies. Parsing and downloads use `loadCuratedWorkspace` to close the namespace graph across those bundles before hydration. Parsing keeps unrelated namespaces as deferred explorer entries; downloads hydrate all selected documents together before generation. `packages/curated-schema` owns production-source selection and the publisher's namespace graph; CI parses CDM, FpML, and Rune runtime sources in one workspace so serialized cross-bundle references retain their targets. Before serialization, `assertValidDocuments` requires completed linking and rejects syntax or reference errors even when semantic validation is disabled. Worker artifact builds use isolated services with the shared standard library so a previous build cannot supply missing declarations. The uploader hashes the prepared manifest set into a cohort, pins dependency manifests to that cohort, and uploads all versioned blobs and immutable cohort manifests before advancing latest pointers. Consumers resolve floating bundle selections through one cohort, so a partial pointer update cannot mix generations. Legacy date versions still select the current manifest; `cohort-<sha256>` versions select immutable manifests and must match the returned cohort. The mirror cron preserves cohort and dependency metadata alongside the serialized namespace graph. Cohort manifests and content-hashed artifacts remain outside daily archive pruning; any future garbage collector must retain the full dependency closure of live cohorts.
- Derive UI previews and validation from authoritative codegen output. A sample awaiting a worker validation result must remain visibly pending; editing alone never establishes validity.
- Preview scalar formats follow the resolved Rune primitive, including aliases and Choice arms. ISO date fields use the shared Preview/Prototype date input and retain `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; timestamps remain distinct from calendar dates.
- Recursive and deep preview objects use finite, namespace-qualified `FormPreviewSchema.definitions` generated by the same Data/Choice builders. `expandPreviewField` relocates one definition body at a time; the shared Preview/Prototype controls expand deferred objects only when a value exists or the user adds one. The eager depth cap limits schema size, not authoring or generated Zod validation depth. Invalid recursive aliases remain language errors.
- Explorer navigation uses the graph node ID; row dragging retains the shared type-reference payload for association editing. In controlled inclusion mode, the row/name toggles the caller-provided canonical selection ID without a navigation highlight; the arrow opens the declaration. Filtering, virtualized rows, and collapsed namespace descendants must not discard explicit selections. The explorer count reports available declarations, independently of graph visibility.
- Parsing and downloads share raw-source collection, including read-only system definitions. Editability must not determine which declarations codegen can resolve; curated bundle metadata and serialized documents use their separate transport.
- Reference models explicitly selected on the launcher seed newly created workspaces, including pre-created Git-backed targets. Creating a workspace from an active one does not inherit its bindings. Saved curated-only workspaces restore their bindings even with zero source files. Failed or unresolved declared bindings remain persisted for retry; after a successful load, explicit unload removes the binding.
- Explorer compacts namespace chains before filtering, retaining common-prefix branches and namespaces with direct declarations. Expanding a parent automatically opens only single-child namespace chains and stops at branching points; collapse clears the whole subtree. Shared namespace-tree helpers preserve canonical paths for expansion and subtree inclusion; the explorer omits per-namespace kind summaries while retaining declaration badges and top-level kind filters.
- `walkNamespace` gathers declarations and computes the type-reference graph, cycles, and emission order once per namespace. Emitters consume the readonly `NamespaceWalkResult` and own their diagnostics/source maps.
- `getTargetRelativePath` centralizes output paths. TypeScript and Python function emitters consume the shared extraction facts in `types/func.ts`; target syntax and runtime remain separate.
- Studio function forms use resolved inherited/dispatch signatures. Codegen `normalizePreviewInputs` adapts plain form values using the shared type resolver and metadata runtime helpers, traversing actual input values independently of form expansion depth. Python input normalization and this adapter share declaration-derived metadata payload shapes from `expr/metadata-input.ts`, including aliases, inherited Data/Choice fields and own/inherited key or template metadata. JSON envelopes retain their metadata and normalize only their payload; records matching declared payload fields take precedence where the two shapes are ambiguous. Python marks runtime-created wrappers with an internal dictionary subclass so repeated function-input normalization preserves their representation without adding JSON keys. Metadata conversion preserves absence before wrapping, including call and constructor boundaries; required cardinality checks still reject missing values.
- Studio function preview transpiles complete generated modules with Sucrase and resolves imports among generated outputs plus the explicit `@js-temporal/polyfill` runtime dependency. Keep private evaluator binding names outside the Rune identifier alphabet (use `$`). Keep the worker execution restrictions and test real parsed/emitted functions when changing this path.
- Builder scope requests include the current workspace sources and serialized dependencies, with canonical file URIs. The parser worker serializes each complete parse/link/scope request so router fallback and concurrent updates cannot query missing or stale documents.
- Core `getFunctionInputs` resolves inherited inputs and dispatch signatures for both codegen and expression scope; external callable scope entries count their declared parameters, and reporting/eligibility rules expose zero or one argument from their declared input. Scope inspection materializes deferred callable descriptions through the shared Rune linker before reading signatures; unrelated model stubs stay deferred.
- Core `getFunctionSignature` resolves dispatch bases from namespace declarations and linked selectors. Language-service scopes and codegen share it, including overloads split across files. Output enum-member scope derives from that effective signature, retaining the correct declaration identity for inherited and dispatch functions when global enum names collide.
- Visual-editor operation drafts use core `parseExpression` for syntax validation before committing any operation. Unknown workspace symbols do not require linking at this boundary; invalid drafts retain their private text.
- Function expression helpers live in `packages/codegen/src/expr/`; preserve cardinality and metadata across call and assignment boundaries. Validate changed semantics with parsed Rune, strict compilation of generated modules, and runtime assertions. Function calls, exported entry points, nested set/add targets, and function outputs share runtime cardinality checks; appends check the combined collection before mutating it. Nested Temporal fields use strings at function boundaries through the shared `RuneFuncData` structural mapping. See the codegen README.
- Core scopes and codegen share `resolveOperationType` and `getOperationArgument` for operator result types and headless pipeline inputs. Keep symbol lookup in its owning context; add operator propagation rules to the shared core utility. Conversion operators expose intrinsic result names: scopes resolve the corresponding workspace record declarations, while codegen retains the semantic type for comparisons without inventing AST declarations. Calendar field reads, including implicit pipeline fields, use the shared `renderCalendarField` emitter because their runtime values are ISO strings.
- Switch guards retain Rune's target restrictions: basic, record, enumeration and alias types can select declared Choice arms, but are not standalone type guards. The broad AST target union accommodates those Choice arm declarations; scope resolution enforces the distinction. `getChoiceTypeScope` shares qualified-name and import-alias handling between `as` and Choice switches.
- Core `getEnumValues` supplies inherited enum members to scopes and emitters. Constructor fields precede metadata keywords; Choice switch guards prefer declared option types over same-named imports.
- Core also owns alias resolution, declared choice-option paths, and choice field names. `as` selects an exact declared choice arm (including nested arms and distinct aliases) or narrows data to a subtype; collection narrowing filters unmatched values. TypeScript retains selected metadata wrappers. When several Choice paths reach the same target, retain each path’s declared wrapper kind and normalize present terminal selections before combining them; never infer wrappers from a payload’s `value` property. Data narrowing uses structural guards because plain JSON inputs have no nominal runtime type tag.
- TypeScript declaration names, annotation decorator factories and their Args types, and callable bindings use `packages/codegen/src/emit/callable-names.ts` across imports, type signatures, expressions, and bundled exports. Resolve calls from declaration identity; preserve original Rune names in function metadata used by Studio and carry the actual export in `GeneratedFunc.exportName` when a function collides with a type.
- Reuse `@rune-langium/worker-core/log` (`createWorkerLogger`, `REDACT_PATHS_BASELINE`) in Cloudflare Workers. Send raw structured objects to `console.log` for field indexing. The shared logger implements redaction explicitly because `pino/browser` does not apply its `redact` option. Pages Functions and the Node container are distinct runtime surfaces.

- Metadata function inputs accept plain form values and already wrapped generated values through the shared preview adapter. Data/Choice envelopes use declared field shapes, preserving ordinary payload fields named `value` or `externalReference`. The pinned CDM battery covers this shared execution seam.

- Inspector section placement is owned by `visual-editor/src/components/forms/sections/config.ts`. Generated form config derives its field assignments from that layout; custom Inspector tabs resolve the same sections with the upstream `SectionRenderer`. Placement includes inherited AST metadata and UI-only comments, which are not all enumerated by the generated schema walker. Standalone section callback props remain a public API.
- Non-React consumers use `@rune-langium/visual-editor/model` for graph state and `/identifiers` for identifier helpers. Workers must not import the full UI barrel. The render gate accepts regenerated schemas into its existing registry during development, preserving workspace consumers while React refreshes the Inspector.

## Deployment and Verification

`pnpm run build:cloudflare` combines the landing page, docs, and Studio under
`apps/docs/.vitepress/dist/`. Source Pages Functions live in
`apps/studio/functions/`; root `functions/` and `wrangler.toml` are generated
build artifacts. Consult [the testing guide](../TESTING.md) for endpoint,
production smoke, and full UX verification commands. Keep evidence from those
checks separate from local unit-test results.

## Expression editing

Studio's Inspector reuses SourceEditor and `documentExtensions` for continuous function implementation and active Data condition editing. Core's implementation range retains same-line, comment-only and trailing body trivia for parsed and serialized models; a body without comments or statements remains a zero-length insertion. Trailing comments on later lines must be indented beyond the declaration; following top-level documentation stays protected. Region views keep the complete owning file in CodeMirror, conceal and protect other regions, and retain full-file UTF-16 offsets (including CRLF bytes). Shared editing transactions preserve CRLF for Enter and paste while retaining one undo entry and leaving externally synchronized bytes intact. The shared editor theme owns typography and chrome density for both views.

`ExpressionDocument` captures file identity, workspace generation, revision and expected range text for guarded edits. It retains mapped regions by file/declaration/target so invalid drafts remain editable after Inspector disposal; edits outside a retained region require fresh parsed coordinates. Parsed workspace entries retain their exact input source while structural form edits wait for reconciliation. Curated source loads on demand for either Source or Inspector and remains read-only. `LspClientService.claimDocumentView` assigns one plugin owner per URI, transfers it on focus, and flushes final pending edits before detachment; closing an inactive view cannot untrack its active peer. A current parse that removes or renames the selected declaration invalidates its editor binding.

The Inspector Builder opens a private expression draft dialog from the current
function caret or selected Data condition. Apply validates the captured workspace,
file revision and original expression bytes, then commits one CodeMirror undo
transaction; Cancel and Escape never write. Unfilled Builder slots render a preview-only invalid Rune marker, so Apply cannot commit them, including after switching to Text. The strict shared serializer rejects placeholders. Reordering/deleting a condition or
editing Source makes an open draft stale. The parser worker exposes core's
canonical expression scope, including dispatch signatures, inherited fields,
earlier aliases, Choice symbols and callable argument counts. Visual-editor reuses the core scope-kind type and omits callables without authoritative arity from its picker. Confirmed zero-input calls remain available. The dialog's Text surface reuses
SourceEditor with a private buffer and no live LSP owner.

Before requesting builder scope, Studio normalizes the owning workspace path to
its URI and sends the current source/dependency snapshot through the parser
worker's existing parse/link pipeline. This also seeds that worker after a router
request falls back to main-thread parsing; it does not create a second resolver.
The worker serializes complete requests over its mutable document/index services,
including scope's parse/link/read sequence. Failed snapshot builds and syntax
errors in the owning document fail the scope request. Unrelated files' syntax
errors do not block a valid owner; no request continues against another
request's documents.

Generated expression views use codegen's recorded projection metadata and the
existing preview worker/session client. TypeScript functions display the exact
emitted declaration; condition fragments are captured during the same emitter
traversal. Display coverage is independent of inverse-lens coverage. Reverse
editing opens a private dialog, schema-validates and reparses the converted Rune
AST, and applies only the captured region with revision guards. Generated whole
functions remain read-only. Function provenance includes trailing implementation
comments through core's source-region helper. The projection worker resolves the
canonical owner and validates the current body binding against source before
selecting its declaration range, including hydrated models without document text;
responses retain the original editor binding. Native scalar operators share the export emitter's
linked type/cardinality proof; collections, metadata, missing values and structured
equality retain their required runtime behavior. Preview file receipts acknowledge
delivery; identical content preserves the linked/generation caches.

Projection lookup compares canonical Langium URIs while replies retain the original
editor binding. Both languages use codegen's `resolveExportSelection` to generate
the selected declaration and its dependency closure, including dispatch siblings.
An unrelated broken declaration must not block a valid projection; a rendering
failure in the selected closure remains visible. Projection cache keys include
language and declaration identity alongside the existing workspace version guard.

Equality projections and exports use compact native scalar comparisons when the
linked type proof permits them. Structural equality and collection comparisons
call `rune.equals(left, right, quantifier?, unequal?)`; the shared runtime owns
pairing, broadcasting, missing values and `all`/`any` behavior. TypeScript, Zod
and executable previews use the same generated runtime source; Python exposes
the same namespace and argument order. Name allocation keeps legal declarations,
aliases and inline parameters named `rune` separate from the runtime namespace.

Other expression runtime calls use the same namespace: `rune.exists`,
`rune.count`, `rune.list`/`single`, conversions, calendar operations and metadata
operations. `contains`, `disjoint` and `distinct` share runtime implementations
instead of emitting per-expression closures. Native operators and standard-library
calls remain inline where their behavior matches. A single runtime composition
function builds TypeScript, JavaScript and sidecar sources, creating the namespace
after its implementations; metadata members follow the existing metadata-use
selection. Namespace aliases retain generic signatures and presence type guards.
Python uses static aliases to its authoritative implementations; dependency
discovery follows both namespace methods and helpers passed as callbacks.

Python expression rendering lives in codegen's `projection/` backend and consumes
the same linked declaration, cardinality, metadata and Choice-path facts. Shared
scalar proofs, Data-selection facts and temporal wire formats serve both targets.
The browser-safe Python runtime string is generated from one authoritative `.py`
file. Grammar reflection drives the expression-kind census; linked execution
fixtures compare Python with the TypeScript emitter, including lexical closure
scope, metadata retention, nanoseconds and daylight-saving transitions.

`generatePythonModule` emits typed input/Data records, enum literals and complete
function bodies. Native declarations require an explicit callable binding;
missing bindings fail visibly. Dispatch normalizes inputs before selecting a
variant, retaining wrappers for its body. Function condition fragments are
captured from that same body traversal. Python and TypeScript share projection
provenance and Studio's file-version/async cache guards; generated views remain
read-only and do not widen the inverse lens.

Rule predicates resolve their declared input through the authoritative type/scope helpers. Python shares implicit field-context initialization with Data conditions; TypeScript rules reuse its Data-condition context, including inherited fields and metadata presence. Named rule fields link through the same typed scope used for navigation.
