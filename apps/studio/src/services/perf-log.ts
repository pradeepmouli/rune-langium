 * infrequent, meaningful events (LSP connect, model load, a toast), and
 * flooding them with one row per keystroke evicts exactly the entries
 * that ring buffer exists to keep. Kept in its own capped buffer instead,
 * exposed read-only via `window.__runeStudioPerfLog`
 * (perf-log-window-bridge.ts) so prod-ux journeys can poll real
 * completion timing instead of guessing a fixed wait, without touching
