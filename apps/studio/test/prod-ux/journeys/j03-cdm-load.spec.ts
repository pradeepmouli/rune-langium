    // the model's real file list (ModelLoader.tsx's isHydrating: curated
    // bundles render "(loading…)" until files.length > 0). Wait for that

    // against the real production corpus, CDM's registry entry pulls in
    // FpML as a dependency, so `ModelLoader.tsx` renders TWO
    // `LoadedModelBadge`s (CDM + FpML), each with its own "(N files)" text —
    // a bare `model-loader`-wide getByText(/\(\d+ files?\)/) hits Playwright
    // strict-mode ambiguity ("resolved to 2 elements") the moment both
    // finish hydrating, and asserting on "any" files-count badge is also
    // semantically wrong here: it could pass on FpML's badge while CDM's own
    // chip is still stuck "(loading…)", defeating the whole point of this
    // wait (confirmed live against production this session). Locate the CDM
    // badge via its already-proven `Unload ${CDM_BUTTON}` accessible name
