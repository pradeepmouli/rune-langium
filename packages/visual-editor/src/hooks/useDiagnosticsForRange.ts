 * overlap iff `a.start < b.end && b.start < a.end`. This matches the
 * standard half-open-interval definition used by CodeMirror and LSP.
 * Zero-length ranges (start === end) never overlap.
 *
 * Severity ordering: 1 (error) > 2 (warn) > 3 (info) > 4 (hint) — lower

 * @param astRange  Character-offset span of the row being tested. When
 *                  `undefined`, returns `undefined` without inspecting the
 *                  diagnostics array (nothing to match against).
 * @param diagnostics  Pre-converted diagnostics for the active file.
 *                     Pass a stable empty array (`[]`) when there are none.
