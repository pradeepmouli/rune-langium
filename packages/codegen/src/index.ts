 * The main barrel (`@rune-langium/codegen`, i.e. this file, resolved via
 * package.json's `"."` export) is intentionally empty.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Spec 021 Phase 2's subpath restructure ("CLEAN FLIP") splits this
 * package's public API by direction — nothing in it is genuinely shared
 * between the two, so the main barrel exports nothing:
 *
 * - `@rune-langium/codegen/export` — the outbound (Rune → target-language)
 *   surface: `generate()`, `generatePreviewSchemas()`, every emitter
 *   contract/option type, `TARGET_DESCRIPTORS`, etc.
 * - `@rune-langium/codegen/import` — the inbound (source → Rune) surface:
 *   `importModel()`, `SourceModel`/`ConstraintIR` types, the CLI's
 *   `runImport`, and import diagnostics.
 * - `@rune-langium/codegen/rosetta` — UNCHANGED: the shared, browser-safe
 *   `.rosetta` render-core consumed by both directions (the outbound
 *   emitters render Rune AST to `.rosetta` text; the inbound importer
 *   renders its built AST-shaped nodes the same way).
 *
 * Import from the subpath that matches what you need; do not add exports
 * here unless a symbol is genuinely used by both `/export` and `/import`
 * (as of this restructure, nothing is — `/rosetta` already covers the one
 * case that legitimately spans both directions).
