# Project Conventions

## Skills

When installing or creating new skills, always:
1. Place the canonical copy in `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Create a relative symlink from `.github/skills/<skill-name>` -> `../../.agents/skills/<skill-name>`

This ensures skills are discoverable from both `.agents/skills/` and `.github/skills/` without duplication.
